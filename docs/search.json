    "section": "Creating Orbit Objects",
    "text": "Creating Orbit Objects\nThere are two ways to create an orbit in Poliastro:\n\nUsing Position and Velocity Vectors\n\nr = [7000, 0, 0] * u.km\nv = [0, 7.5, 1] * u.km / u.s\nepoch = Time(\"2025-01-01\", scale=\"utc\")\n\norbit1 = Orbit.from_vectors(Earth, r, v, epoch=epoch)\nThis method is useful when you have raw observational data or simulation outputs.\nNote: When creating orbits from vectors, epoch is required. This is the time at which the vectors are valid.\n\nUsing Classical Orbital Elements\n\nYou can also define an orbit using elements like:\n\nSemi-major axis (a): average size of the orbit\nEccentricity (ecc): shape of the orbit\nInclination (inc): tilt of the orbit relative to Earth‚Äôs equator\nRAAN: Right Ascension of the Ascending Node\nArgument of perigee (argp)\nTrue anomaly (nu): position of the object along the orbit\n\nHere‚Äôs how to define a circular orbit at 500 km altitude with a 30¬∞ inclination:\na_circ = Earth.R + 500 * u.km\ninc_circ = 30 * u.deg\norbit2 = Orbit.circular(Earth, alt=500 * u.km, inc=inc_circ)\nNow, let‚Äôs define an elliptical orbit with perigee at 500 km and apogee at 1500 km:\nr_p = Earth.R + 500 * u.km  # Perigee\nr_a = Earth.R + 1500 * u.km # Apogee\n\na = (r_p + r_a) / 2                     # Semi-major axis\necc = (r_a - r_p) / (r_a + r_p)        # Eccentricity\ninc = 60 * u.deg                       # Inclination\nraan = 30 * u.deg\nargp = 0 * u.deg\nnu = 0 * u.deg\n\norbit3 = Orbit.from_classical(Earth, a, ecc, inc, raan, argp, nu)\nNote: You don‚Äôt need to provide epoch when creating orbits using classical elements ‚Äî the default is J2000, the standard astronomical epoch corresponding to January 1, 2000, 12:00 TT.\n\nA Note on Units and u.one\nPoliastro uses Astropy Units to manage dimensions. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll often see values like:\necc = 0.1 * u.one  # Eccentricity is dimensionless\nHere, u.one is a special unit that denotes ‚Äúdimensionless‚Äù quantities. This ensures compatibility with Astropy‚Äôs quantity system while preserving physical correctness.\n\n\nWhat is J2000?\nJ2000 refers to January 1, 2000, 12:00 TT (Terrestrial Time). It‚Äôs a standard epoch used in astronomy and orbital mechanics.\nIn Poliastro, if you don‚Äôt specify an epoch, it defaults to J2000. Since Poliastro assumes perfect Keplerian motion (i.e., no perturbations), these orbits don‚Äôt change over time ‚Äî so using J2000 as the default epoch is a safe baseline."
