    "text": "Hello! I am Madhukara. Welcome to my blog!\nA few years ago, I worked in the space industry. Then, as often happens, life moved in a different direction. I stepped away ‚Äî not entirely by choice ‚Äî and found myself on another path. But the interest in space systems never really left. Now, I‚Äôm following that fascination.\nI‚Äôve been revisiting the foundations of orbital mechanics, space systems, and mission design. As I read and explore, I write. Each chapter began as a self-study note ‚Äî an attempt to understand something clearly and explain it carefully. Along the way, I‚Äôve also begun learning about scientific software development, with the hope that one day I can contribute through code as well as concepts.\nI‚Äôve been sharing parts of this journey on LinkedIn ‚Äî learning in public, as they say. It‚Äôs not always easy, but it‚Äôs helped me stay focused and connected. I‚Äôve also embraced AI as a partner and a guide in this process ‚Äî not to bypass effort, but to learn more deeply and work more steadily.\nI‚Äôve started with the basics ‚Äî the aim is to go deeper, and eventually build the skills to write scientific software for space systems."
