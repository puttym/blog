Hello! I am Madhukara. Welcome to my blog!

<p align="left">
A few years ago, I worked in the space industry. Then, as often happens, life
moved in a different direction. I stepped away — not entirely by choice — and
found myself on another path. But the interest in space systems never really
left. Now, I’m following that fascination.

I’ve been revisiting the foundations of orbital mechanics, space systems, and
mission design. As I read and explore, I write. Each chapter began as a
self-study note — an attempt to understand something clearly and explain it
carefully. Along the way, I’ve also begun learning about scientific software
development, with the hope that one day I can contribute through code as well as
concepts.

I’ve been sharing parts of this journey on LinkedIn — learning in public, as
they say. It’s not always easy, but it’s helped me stay focused and connected.
I’ve also embraced AI as a partner and a guide in this process — not to bypass
effort, but to learn more deeply and work more steadily.

I’ve started with the basics — the aim is to go deeper, and eventually build the
skills to write scientific software for space systems.
