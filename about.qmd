Hello! I am Madhukara. Welcome to my blog!

I’m exploring space systems and scientific software, with the help of AI.

This blog is a reflection of my journey — learning one step at a time, and
building in public.

I work with AI not just as a tool, but as a thinking partner, editor, and
teacher. Most blog posts here are part of that collaboration. You’ll also find
these ideas on my LinkedIn, where I regularly share posts about the work and the
evolving way I do it.

My goal is to become very good at what I do — and to stay true to the process.
